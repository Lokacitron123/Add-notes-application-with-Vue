# Add notes application with Vue 3

This is a small project for testing out Vue 3. The things I've learned from this little project is on a basic level how Vue 3 works.
I have learned:  

1. Vue's ref method to connect data throughout the application
2. Vue's v-if and v-for methods for rendering html in my template
3. Vue's onMounted and watch methods


## Project Setup

npm install
npm run dev
